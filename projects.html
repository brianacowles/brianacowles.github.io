            <p>In high school, one of my English teachers issued a mandatory word count for our papers; however, there were some restrictions. Words three letters or less, in quotes, or in parentheses did not count towards the total. If I wanted to know how long my paper was, I would have to count it out by hand. Through the VJM Wordcounter, I've alleviated this problem. </p>
            
            <p>This program works on a simple algorithm that splits words into lists while traversing user input. First, the input is split on the double quote character (") using the <code>.Split()</code> method. By the nature of this method we now have a list where every other element has words that are canidates for the total. If the first item in the list is an empty character, it follows that the third item in the list will be the first nonquoted character. This is due to how the <code>Split</code> method functions. If the first item in the list is not in quotes, then we can proceed as normal and add each even item to a new list. When we convert the new list to a string we can follow the same logic after splitting on parentheses.</p>

            <p>Finally, we have a complete list of candidates. Now I iterate through each word in the list and check if it is greater than three characters. If it is, then I increment a count and, once the end of the list is reached, display it to the user.</p>
                
            <p>The following is a flowchart for this program:</p>

                <p>Critical path analysis is a planning technique that allows you to optimize your schedule. CritPa is a browser-integrated java application that will allow users to plan almost anything. Not sure when to start Thanksgiving dinner? Having trouble managing a slew of school assignments? CritPa can help. Simply enter the tasks you need to complete, the amount of time each will take, and what steps are dependent on each other. We'll do the rest. For ease of access, a sequential checklist will be provided to the user. Alternatively, the user can view a Gantt chart, an illustrative version of the project schedule.</p>
                <p>Sometimes things don't go to plan. If you need to complete a project earlier than expected or are falling behind, reassessing your list is easy. If you're unsure how long a particular stage will take, CritPa can help you estimate it using PERT (program evaluation and review technique). Input the shortest possible time, the most likely time, and the longest possible time. CritPa will then show you the estimated time.</p>
                <p>Users can use the app without signing in; however, in order to save a schedule on the server, they will need to make an account. This will be a simple username and password system to make it as easy as possible. Users can save up to five schedules at a time, and download a png of the Gantt chart of any schedule they make.</p>
                <p>Interested in CritPa? View the application's development on my <a href="https://trello.com/b/PvM1otrR/critpa">Trello page</a> or <a href="https://github.com/brianacowles/critpa">GitHub</a>!</p>

                <p>If you use Linux, chances are you have a few dotfiles, files used to customize your system. Some dotfiles need to stay in specific locations, so it's difficult to create a single folder to upload to a repository. I use Arch, and I wrote a crazy alias in my .bashrc that would allow me to upload all of my dotfiles to my repository simply named "updot". Whenever I would add new dotfiles, it was a hassle to edit this alias. Now I'm seeking to remove all annoyances and make a bash script to do it all easily. Run the script and type the names of the files you'd like to add to the repository (with prompts of course). The script will create a text file and read from it any time you want your dotfiles uploaded. Optionally, the user can save a local copy of the updated repository.</p>
